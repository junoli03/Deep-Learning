To create a new conda environment with Python, you can use the following command:

```conda create --n my_env python=3.10```

This will create a new conda environment called "my_env". To activate this environment, you can use the following command:

```conda activate my_env```

Once the environment is activated, you can use the conda command to install packages into the environment, for example:

```conda install numpy```

You can also use pip to install Python packages within the isolated environment.

To deactivate the environment, you can use the following command:

```conda deactivate```

And to delete the environment, you can use the following command:

```conda env remove --n my_env```

This will remove the "my_env" environment from your system.
